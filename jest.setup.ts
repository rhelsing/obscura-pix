 * exactly the ordering footgun that makes people reach for `require()` in the middle of a test.
 * Doing it once in setup means suites can `import { Obscura } from '../ObscuraModule'` normally.
 *
 * See `src/native/__fixtures__/FakeObscuraBridge.ts` for what the double is and, more importantly,
 * what it must not become.
